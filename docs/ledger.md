- Needed better visual hierarchy, color coding, and delightful microinteractions
- Removing unnecessary channel selection step streamlined the workflow
- Enhanced UI makes the complex automation creation process more intuitive and enjoyable

### Files Touched
- `src/components/automations/AutomationWizard.jsx` - Complete refactor with all visual improvements
- `src/components/automations/AutomationWizard.jsx.backup` - Backup of original file

## 2025-10-01: SMS Auth Hardening + STOP/HELP Auto-Replies

### What Changed
- Added Bearer auth + business ownership enforcement to SMS endpoints
  - `api/sms/send.js`: verifies token, checks `profiles.business_id` matches `businessId`
  - `api/surge/provision-number.js`: same enforcement before provisioning
- Implemented webhook auto-replies
  - `api/sms/webhook.js`: STOP sets `contacts.opted_out=true` and sends confirmation; HELP sends support info

### Why This Was Needed
- Ensure multi-tenant isolation and prevent cross-tenant access on SMS actions
- Meet compliance expectations for opt-out and help keywords on inbound SMS

### Files Touched
- `api/sms/send.js`
- `api/surge/provision-number.js`
- `api/sms/webhook.js`
- `docs/SMS_NEXT_STEPS.md`

### How Verified
- Added lightweight handler tests with stubbed deps:
  - `scripts/test-sms-send-handler.cjs`: 401 without auth, 403 on mismatch, 200 on success
  - `scripts/test-sms-provision-handler.cjs`: 401 without auth, 200 on success
  - `scripts/test-sms-webhook-handler.cjs`: inbound STOP/HELP return 200; STOP sets opt-out and replies
- Existing broader API scripts also executed to ensure no regressions in runtime

## 2025-01-29: Fix Default Landing Tab for Authenticated Users

- Fixed RouteGuards.tsx, Landing.jsx, Paywall.jsx, UserMenu.tsx, and AuthCTA.tsx to use `/dashboard`
- Maintained existing `/reporting` â†’ `/analytics` legacy mapping for backward compatibility

### Why This Was Needed
- User reported that authenticated users with active subscriptions were always landing on the Analytics tab
- This was confusing UX as users expected to land on the main Dashboard tab first
- The `/reporting` route was being used as the default redirect, which mapped to Analytics instead of Dashboard

### Files Touched
- `src/components/auth/AuthGuard.tsx` - Updated redirect paths from `/reporting` to `/dashboard`

### How Verified
- Updated all authentication guards to redirect to `/dashboard` instead of `/reporting`
- Maintained backward compatibility by keeping `/reporting` â†’ `/analytics` mapping
- All user-facing dashboard links now point to `/dashboard` (Dashboard tab)
- Authentication flow now properly lands users on Dashboard tab as expected
- Navigation structure remains intact with Dashboard as first tab in sidebar

- Webhook ensures database stays in sync with Stripe subscription changes
- Reduces maintenance burden by using Stripe's built-in billing interface
- Provides better UX for subscription management compared to custom modal

### Files Touched

- Empty green boxes looked bad and served no purpose
- Buttons needed consistent gradient styling for better visual appeal
- "Maybe Later" button should close window as expected
- Close button on 1-3 star screen needed gradient and should just say "Close"

### Files Touched
- `src/pages/FeedbackCollection.jsx` - Updated 1-3 star and 4-5 star thank you screens
- `src/pages/QRRedirect.jsx` - Applied gradient to Google Review button
- `src/pages/ReviewLanding.jsx` - Applied gradient to Leave Review button

### How Verified
- Main feedback form already had gradient icon and submit button

- Added HMAC webhook signature verification for QBO webhooks
- Created comprehensive test endpoints and automation scripts for validation
- Implemented AI-assisted template matching based on invoice descriptions and keywords

### Why This Was Needed
- User needed QBO invoice events to automatically trigger review request automations

- Created helper functions for business lookup and creation by email
- Fixed foreign key constraints that were blocking the migration

### Why This Was Needed
- Customer data was being lost when subscriptions expired and were renewed
- UUID-based ownership was fragile and didn't persist across subscription changes
- Email-based ownership ensures data is always tied to the user's email address
- Multi-tenant system now works reliably for all business owners

### Files Touched

- Sets expectations that analytics features are under development

### Files Touched
- `src/pages/Analytics.jsx` - Replaced full analytics dashboard with coming soon screen

### How Verified
- No linter errors after changes
