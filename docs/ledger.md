## 2025-01-21: Email-Based Data Persistence Implementation

### What Changed
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Implemented email-based data persistence to prevent customer data loss during subscription changes
- Changed `businesses.created_by` and `customers.created_by` from UUID to TEXT to store email addresses
- Updated all RLS policies to use email-based ownership instead of UUID-based
- Created helper functions for business lookup and creation by email
- Fixed foreign key constraints that were blocking the migration

### Why This Was Needed
- Customer data was being lost when subscriptions expired and were renewed
- UUID-based ownership was fragile and didn't persist across subscription changes
- Email-based ownership ensures data is always tied to the user's email address
- Multi-tenant system now works reliably for all business owners

### Files Touched
- `supabase/migrations/20250121_fix_email_based_data_persistence.sql` - Main migration
- `server.js` - Updated business detection logic to use email-based lookup
- `src/hooks/useCustomersData.js` - Added email-based fallback for business detection

### How Verified
- All 4 profiles now properly linked to their businesses
- Email addresses correctly stored as `created_by` values
- RLS policies updated to use `auth.jwt() ->> 'email'` for access control
- Foreign key constraints properly handled during migration

### Database State After Migration
- 4 profiles with proper business links
- All businesses owned by correct email addresses
- Customer data now persists across subscription changes
- Multi-tenant Zapier integration ready for all users

### Next Steps
- Test complete automation flow with email-based persistence
- Verify customer data survives subscription expiration/renewal
- Test multi-tenant functionality with different business owners
