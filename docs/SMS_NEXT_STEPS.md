# SMS System - Next Steps After Surge Plan Upgrade

## Current Status ‚úÖ

**Everything is built and deployed!** The complete SMS system is ready to go.

### What's Working:
- ‚úÖ Database migration complete (messages, contacts tables, businesses SMS columns)
- ‚úÖ All API endpoints deployed and functional
- ‚úÖ Settings ‚Üí Messaging page with provision wizard
- ‚úÖ Real Surge API integration implemented
- ‚úÖ Webhook handler ready for status updates
- ‚úÖ Test SMS form ready to use once verified

### Current Blocker:
**Surge account limit reached** - Your current Surge plan has hit the maximum number of phone numbers allowed. Error message:
```
"Your account has exceeded the maximum number of allowed phone numbers. 
Upgrade your plan to increase this limit."
```

## What To Do After Upgrading Surge Plan

### Step 1: Upgrade Surge Plan
- Log into Surge dashboard
- Upgrade to a plan that allows more toll-free numbers
- Confirm upgrade is active

### Step 2: Reset and Re-Provision
Once your Surge plan is upgraded, in Supabase run:
```sql
UPDATE businesses 
SET surge_account_id = NULL, 
    surge_phone_id = NULL, 
    from_number = NULL, 
    verification_status = 'pending'
WHERE id = '674fedc5-7937-4054-bffd-e4ecc22abc1d';
```

### Step 3: Provision Real TFN
1. Go to: **https://myblipp.com/settings?tab=messaging**
2. Click "Get a free SMS number"
3. Fill out the form with Blipp's business information:
   - Legal Business Name: "Blipp" (or your registered business name)
   - Website: https://myblipp.com
   - Address: Your actual business address
   - EIN: Your actual EIN or check "Sole Prop"
   - Contact Name: Your name
   - Contact Email: Your email
   - Opt-In Method: "Website Form"
   - Terms/Privacy: Pre-filled and locked ‚úÖ

4. Click "Get SMS Number"
5. Confirm the warning dialog

### Step 4: Wait for Verification
- You'll see: "Pending Verification" badge
- A real toll-free number will be displayed
- Surge will review your campaign (typically 1-3 business days)
- Status polls every 30 seconds automatically
- When approved, webhook updates status to "Active"

### Step 5: Test SMS Sending
Once status shows "Active":
1. Test SMS form will appear
2. Enter phone: +14179732866 (your number)
3. Type message: "Testing SMS from Blipp!"
4. Click "Send Test SMS"
5. Check your phone - you should receive the text!

## Environment Variables (Already Set)

Verify these are in both `.env.local` and Vercel:
- ‚úÖ `SURGE_API_KEY` - Your Surge API key
- ‚úÖ `SURGE_ACCOUNT_ID` - Your Surge account ID
- ‚úÖ `SURGE_SIGNING_KEY` - Your Surge signing key
- ‚úÖ `SURGE_API_BASE=https://api.surge.app`
- ‚úÖ `SURGE_USE_SUBACCOUNTS=false`
- ‚úÖ `APP_BASE_URL=https://myblipp.com`

## Surge Webhook Configuration

In Surge dashboard, add one webhook URL:
```
https://myblipp.com/api/sms/webhook
```

This handles all events:
- Message delivery status updates
- Inbound SMS messages
- Verification/campaign status updates

## What Happens When You Submit the Form

### Backend Flow:
1. **Create Account**: Uses your `SURGE_ACCOUNT_ID` from env
2. **Purchase TFN**: Calls `POST /accounts/{account_id}/phone_numbers` with `type: 'toll_free'`
3. **Create Campaign**: Calls `POST /accounts/{account_id}/campaigns` with:
   - Business info from form
   - 3 sample messages with compliance footer
   - Use cases: account_notification, customer_care, delivery_notification
   - Volume: low (2000 SMS/day to T-Mobile)
   - Privacy/Terms URLs
4. **Save to Database**: Stores account ID, phone ID, TFN number, verification status
5. **Return Success**: Shows TFN and "Pending" status

### What Gets Created in Surge:
- Real toll-free number assigned to your account
- Campaign for verification with your business details
- Pending approval status

   - Need to add session token validation

2. **Webhook Auto-Replies**: 
   - STOP keyword auto-reply not implemented yet
   - HELP keyword auto-reply not implemented yet

3. **Subaccounts**:
   - Currently all businesses share one Surge account
