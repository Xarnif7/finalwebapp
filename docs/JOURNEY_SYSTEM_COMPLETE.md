## 🗄️ Backend (Database) - COMPLETE ✅

### **Database Migration**
File: `supabase/migrations/20251009_journey_per_step_messages.sql`

Added columns to `sequence_steps` table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE sequence_steps 
ADD COLUMN message_purpose TEXT,
ADD COLUMN message_config JSONB DEFAULT '{}';
```

**message_purpose** values:
- `thank_you`
- `follow_up`
- `review_request`
- `rebooking`
- `retention`
- `upsell`
- `custom`

**message_config** structure:
```json
// For Email
{
  "purpose": "thank_you",
  "subject": "Thank you for choosing {{business.name}}!",
  "body": "Hi {{customer.name}}...",
  "variables": ["customer.name", "business.name", "review_link"]
}

// For SMS
{
  "purpose": "follow_up",
  "body": "Hi {{customer.name}}, just checking in!",
  "variables": ["customer.name"]
}
```

---

## 🔌 Backend (APIs) - COMPLETE ✅

### **1. Updated `/api/sequences` POST Endpoint**
Location: `server.js` lines 4172-4319

**Changes:**
- ✅ Creates sequence in `sequences` table
- ✅ Creates `sequence_steps` with `message_purpose` and `message_config`
- ✅ Properly maps flowSteps from frontend to database records
- ✅ Supports both new schema (sequences/sequence_steps) and legacy (automation_sequences)

**Request Body:**
```javascript
{
  name: "Customer Lifecycle Journey",
  trigger_type: "qbo",
  trigger_event_type: "invoice_paid",
  steps: [
    {
      kind: "send_email",
      step_index: 1,
      wait_ms: 0,
      message_purpose: "thank_you",
      message_config: {
        subject: "Thank you!",
        body: "Hi {{customer.name}}..."
      }
    },
    {
      kind: "send_sms",
      step_index: 2,
      wait_ms: 3600000,
      message_purpose: "follow_up",
      message_config: {
        body: "How did it go?"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### **2. Created `/api/sequences/enroll` Endpoint**
Location: `server.js` lines 4321-4409

**Purpose:** Enroll customers in journeys (start their journey)

**Features:**
- ✅ Validates customer not already enrolled
- ✅ Gets first step of sequence
- ✅ Calculates next_run_at based on first step's wait_ms
- ✅ Creates sequence_enrollments record
- ✅ Returns enrollment ID and next execution time

**Usage:**
```javascript
POST /api/sequences/enroll
{
  "sequence_id": "uuid",
  "customer_id": "uuid",
  "business_id": "uuid",
  "trigger_source": "manual" // or "qbo_webhook", "zapier", etc.
}
```

### **3. Created `/api/_cron/journey-executor` Endpoint**
Location: `server.js` lines 4411-4544

**Purpose:** Execute journey steps on schedule (cron job)

**Features:**
- ✅ Queries active enrollments where `next_run_at <= NOW()`
- ✅ Fetches current step with `message_purpose` and `message_config`
- ✅ Resolves variables ({{customer.name}}, {{review_link}}, etc.)
- ✅ Logs messages (ready for actual email/SMS sending)
- ✅ Advances enrollment to next step
- ✅ Calculates next_run_at based on next step's wait_ms
- ✅ Marks journey as finished when no more steps

**Execution Flow:**
```
1. Find enrollments ready to execute
2. For each enrollment:
   a. Get current step from sequence_steps
   b. Read message_config for that step
   c. Resolve variables in message
   d. Send email/SMS (currently logged)
   e. Move to next step
   f. Schedule next execution based on wait_ms
3. Return statistics
```

Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql

ALTER TABLE sequence_steps 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS message_purpose TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS message_config JSONB DEFAULT '{}';

-- Add index for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_sequence_steps_message_purpose 
ON sequence_steps(message_purpose);

-- Update existing steps to have default custom purpose
UPDATE sequence_steps 
SET message_purpose = 'custom',
    message_config = CASE
