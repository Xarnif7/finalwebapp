# Navigation Migration Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the migration from the previous navigation structure to the new consolidated MVP navigation with six main tabs.

## New Navigation Structure

The dashboard now has six main tabs:

1. **Customers** - Customer management and data
2. **Automations** - All automation and outreach features  
3. **Reviews** - Review management and performance
4. **Reporting** - Analytics, KPIs, and insights (main dashboard)
5. **Settings** - Configuration and administration
6. **Public Feedback** - Public-facing features (feature flagged)

## Feature Flags

### PUBLIC_FEEDBACK_ENABLED

The Public Feedback tab is controlled by the `PUBLIC_FEEDBACK_ENABLED` feature flag.

**Default:** `false` (disabled)

**To enable:**
1. Set environment variable: `VITE_PUBLIC_FEEDBACK_ENABLED=true`
2. Or enable at runtime: `localStorage.setItem('PUBLIC_FEEDBACK_ENABLED', 'true')`
3. Or use the development feature flag toggle (dev builds only)

**Behavior:**
- When disabled: Public Feedback tab is hidden from navigation
- When enabled: Public Feedback tab appears in navigation
- Route protection: `/public-feedback` returns 404 when flag is disabled

## Redirect Behavior

All legacy URLs automatically redirect to their new locations using React Router's `Navigate` component with `replace={true}`. This ensures:

1. **SEO-friendly:** URLs are replaced in browser history
2. **Query parameters preserved:** Any query parameters are maintained during redirect
3. **Immediate redirect:** No flash of old content

## Implementation Notes

### Code Changes

1. **Centralized Navigation Config** (`src/config/nav.ts`)
   - Single source of truth for navigation structure
   - Feature flag integration
   - Legacy URL mapping

2. **Feature Flag System** (`src/lib/featureFlags.ts`)
   - Runtime and build-time flag support
   - Event-driven updates
   - Development toggle component

3. **Updated Routing** (`src/pages/index.jsx`)
   - New consolidated route structure
   - Automatic legacy redirects
   - Feature flag route protection

4. **Updated Sidebar** (`src/components/dashboard/ModernSidebar.jsx`)
   - Uses centralized navigation config
   - Feature flag filtering
   - Dynamic icon mapping

### Testing

1. **Manual Testing Checklist:**
   - [ ] All six tabs load without 404s
   - [ ] Legacy URLs redirect correctly
   - [ ] Breadcrumbs reflect new structure
   - [ ] Feature flags work correctly
   - [ ] Navigation highlights active sections
   - [ ] Mobile navigation works
   - [ ] Keyboard navigation works

2. **Automated Testing:**
   - Route redirect tests
   - Feature flag tests
   - Navigation component tests

## Rollback Plan

If rollback is needed:

1. Revert `src/pages/index.jsx` to previous route structure
2. Revert `src/components/dashboard/ModernSidebar.jsx` to previous navigation
3. Remove feature flag system if not needed
4. Update any hardcoded navigation references

## Future Enhancements

1. **Settings Subsections:** Implement left-rail navigation for settings subsections
2. **Reporting KPIs:** Add prominent KPI display at top of reporting page
3. **Breadcrumb System:** Implement dynamic breadcrumbs based on current route
4. **Role-based Navigation:** Hide/show navigation items based on user roles
5. **Analytics Integration:** Track navigation usage for future optimization

## Support

1. Check this documentation first
2. Review the centralized navigation config
3. Test with feature flags in development
4. Check browser console for routing errors
