## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Small:** Don't set up all integrations at once. Get 3 users on email-only first.

2. **Collect Feedback:** Every conversation with early users is gold. Document feature requests.

3. **Iterate Fast:** Fix bugs quickly. Early users are forgiving if you're responsive.

4. **Add Features Gradually:** Stripe next week, SMS in 2 weeks. Don't overwhelm yourself.

5. **Monitor Closely:** Check logs daily for the first week. Catch issues early.

6. **Document Everything:** Keep updating `docs/ledger.md` with changes and learnings.

---

## 🚀 Let's Ship It!

Your MVP is **ready**. The code works. The docs are complete. The path is clear.

Now it's time to:
1. Deploy to Vercel (15 minutes)
2. Onboard 3 real users (this week)
3. Collect feedback
4. Iterate and improve

**You've got this!** 🎉
