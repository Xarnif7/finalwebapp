## 🎯 How It Works (End-to-End)

### Step 1: User Connects Jobber
```
User clicks "Connect Jobber" 
    ↓
Redirects to Jobber OAuth
    ↓
User logs in + approves
    ↓
Callback saves tokens to integrations_jobber
    ↓
Webhook automatically configured
    ↓
Customer sync triggered
    ↓
User sees "Jobber Connected ✅"
```

### Step 2: Customer Sync
```
All Jobber clients fetched via GraphQL
    ↓
Name, email, phone, address extracted
    ↓
Upserted to customers table
    ↓
external_id = Jobber client ID
    ↓
source = 'jobber'
```

### Step 3: Journey Created
```
User creates journey in Journey Builder
    ↓
Selects trigger: Jobber → Job Completed
    ↓
Configures messages (email/SMS)
    ↓
Sets timing (e.g., 24 hours after job)
    ↓
Saves + activates journey
```

### Step 4: Job Completes → Journey Triggers
```
Job marked complete in Jobber
    ↓
Jobber sends webhook to /api/crm/jobber/webhook
    ↓
Webhook handler:
  - Fetches job details from Jobber API
  - Extracts customer info
  - Upserts customer to database
  - Finds sequences with trigger_event_type='job_completed'
  - Enrolls customer in each matching journey
    ↓
Journey executor (cron) processes:
  - Waits for scheduled time
  - Resolves variables ({{customer.name}}, etc.)
  - Sends via Resend (email) or Twilio (SMS)
    ↓
Message delivered to customer!
```

## 🧪 Testing Results

```bash
node scripts/test-jobber-complete.js
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Database schema ready (needs migration)
- ✅ Customers table ready
- ✅ Found 1 journey listening for job_completed
- ✅ All 6 API endpoints created
- ✅ Environment variables configured

**Only Remaining Step:**
Run migration in Supabase Dashboard (1 minute):
```sql
-- Copy/paste supabase/migrations/20251009_jobber_integration_complete.sql
-- into Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → Run
```

## 🎨 Frontend Integration

**AutomationWizard updated:**
```jsx
jobber: {
  name: 'Jobber',
  available: true  // ← NOW AVAILABLE!
}

// 8 triggers added:
JOBBER_TRIGGERS = {
  'job_completed': { name: 'Job Completed', ... }, ✅
  'job_closed': { name: 'Job Closed', ... },
  'invoice_paid': { name: 'Invoice Paid', ... },
  'visit_completed': { name: 'Visit Completed', ... },
  'quote_approved': { name: 'Quote Approved', ... },
  'invoice_sent': { name: 'Invoice Sent', ... },
  'client_created': { name: 'Client Created', ... },
  'job_started': { name: 'Job Started', ... }
}
```

Users can now select Jobber in Journey Builder Step 1!

## 🔄 Token Refresh System

**Auto-refresh every hour:**
```javascript
// In server.js - /api/cron/refresh-qbo-tokens
// Now refreshes BOTH QBO and Jobber tokens

// Jobber tokens:
- Check if expires in < 1 hour
- Auto-refresh using refresh_token
- Update integrations_jobber table
- Mark as token_expired if fails
```

**Setup:**
- Already integrated into existing QBO cron
- Runs hourly (0 * * * *)
- No additional configuration needed
